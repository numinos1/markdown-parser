# Mulholland Dr

- howdy
- howdy to you

- beautiful evenin
- yeah

- sure want to thank you for comin' all the way up here to see me from that nice hotel downtown
- no problem, what's on your mind?

- well now, here's a man who want's to get right down to it; kinda anxious to get to it, are you?
- whatever...

- man's attitude; man's attitude goes some ways; the way his life will be; is that somethin' you might agree with?
- sure

- now did answer because that's what you thought I wanted to hear, or did you think about what I said, and answer, because you truly believe that to be right?
- I agree with what you said; truly.

- What'd I say?
- That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

- so since you agree, you must be a person who does not care about the good life.
- how's that?

- we'll stop for a little second, think about it; can you do that for me?
- ok, I'm thinking.

- No, you're not thinkin, you're too busy being a smart alek to be thinkin. Now I want you to think, and stop being a smart alec. Can you try that for me?
- Look, where is this going? What do you want me to do?

- There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
- One

- So let's just say I'm driving this buggy, and if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me.
- ok

- I want you to go back to work tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead actress anyway. Audition many girls for the part. When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say, this is the girl. The rest of the cast can stay, it's up to you. But that lead girl is not up to you. Now you will see me one more time if you do good. You'll see me two more times if you do bad. Goodnight.
