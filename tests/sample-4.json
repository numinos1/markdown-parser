After sailing the Atlantic in May 1856, they traveled by handcart with the James G. Willie company to Utah. The journey was difficult, and Emily said many backed out within a few days, but she was determined to pull her handcart all the way to the Salt Lake Valley."

I set down my foot that I would try, and by the blessing of God I pulled a handcart a thousand miles and never rode one step.\""
